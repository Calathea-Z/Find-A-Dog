Sometimes folks just want to see photos of cute dogs. Our app's mission is to solve the problem of by allowing the user to randomly generate a photo of a dog from a group of over  1000 dog photos. 

WireFrame & Component Hierarchy: https://tinyurl.com/zb3psbv3



User Stories:

The user will open our app with the intention of seeing a random photo of a dog. It populates a random photo on the screen. The user can then press the randomize button in order to generate another random dog photo. There is also functionality to look up photos by the specific breed. The user can browse a list of these breeds or search for specific breeds using the search bar. There is a link at the bottom of the app for the user to seek out information about adopting a dog. 

Planned Future Features: 
1. Integrate the ability to allow the user to look up where to adopt dogs near their location. 
2. Add functionality to search by sub breed (ie. Bulldog ---> French Bulldog).

API: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/

Technologies Used: This is a React application. CSS Flex-Box was used to build the UI.
